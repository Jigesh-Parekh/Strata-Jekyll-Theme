<img src="/images/fulls/blender.jpg" class="fit image"> Beginners luck in creating a Blender object

I have been fortunate enough to be employed to a company that explores new bleeding edge technologies, and recently I have been tasked to explore virtual and augmented reality platforms to develop enterprise level solutions. The small downside to this luxury is that these new technologies incorporate a lot 3d rendering which are of skills typical to computer artists and/or game developers. My company lacks those employees in favor of typical CAD engineers , so I took it upon myself to start developing renderings in blender as a way to be an ace in the hole for any object creation needs within my organization. 

Blender is a free to download and use 3d content creation platform and to a beginner, is pretty daunting application suite to use. Your keyboard and mouse instantly become alien objects if you approach blender blindly – I found using youtube videos was a good platform to learn how to navigate the blender environment for basic camera and object management. 

After an hour or so of mimicking YouTube blender tutors, I felt fairly comfortable manipulating basic objects and started to mock up a design for an airplane tow bar,  a device used to taxi commercial airliners around the runway for preflight or post flight maintenance. Roughly 4 hours into my work day to my surprise, co workers started noticing my developments, and to their surprise after I told them it was my first time. 

I realized a lot of the black magic for blender resides in its button commands. Manipulating a 3d object on a 2d plane (monitor) is a tall order with just a mouse for directional input. The keyboard functions as a controller to quickly scale, rotate and splice an object with respect to its X, Y, and Z plane. 

Below is my first attempt at creating an object from a google image, using creative deduction to fill in the gray areas of what types of objects are located where. I’m pretty proud on how it turned out for only using a platform for a few hours, I look forward to further developing 3d rendering, texturing and mapping as a skill set for future platforms.
